# Filament Spool Scale ALFA (V0.1)
## _DIY Filament Spool Scale integrated into filament holder_

Do It Yourself Filament Spool Scale which is integrated into the filament holder so you can easily monitor your remaining filament. By default it is not using batteries so you can hook it up straight to the printer/power suply. Optionaly you can add battery by soldering extension wires to prepared pads and than attach battery. 

## Features

- Open-source
- Custom PCB
- OLED 0.91 inch display
- Buttons (one under the display so it clicks when you push the display)
- By double-clicking button subtract spool dry mass
- Powered by Arduino Nano
- Compatible with stock Ender 3 spool holder, Prusa Original frame
